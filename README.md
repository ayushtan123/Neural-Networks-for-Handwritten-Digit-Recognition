# Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition (Binary)

This repository contains code for a simple neural network implemented using both **Tensorflow/Keras** and **NumPy**. The neural network is designed for recognizing handwritten digits, specifically "**zero**" and "**one**" (binary classification).

## Features
- Two approaches: **Tensorflow/Keras** and custom implementation in **NumPy**.
- Dataset: **1000 examples** of **20x20 grayscale images** of "**zero**" and "**one**."
- Neural Network Architecture: Three layers with **sigmoid activation functions**.
- Model Implementation: Keras **Sequential model** in **Tensorflow**.
- Forward Propagation: Manual implementation using **NumPy** for the custom neural network.
- Optional Vectorized **NumPy** Implementation: Provided for more efficient calculations.
- Pre-trained Weights and Biases: Loaded from the **Tensorflow** model into the custom **NumPy** model.
- Predictions Comparison: Between **Tensorflow** and **NumPy** models for a random subset of the dataset.
- Results Visualization: Demonstrates the network's performance in recognizing handwritten digits.

## Usage
To run the code, execute the cells in a Jupyter Notebook environment. Follow the instructions provided in each section, completing exercises if necessary.

## Credits
This code is part of a practice lab for implementing neural networks and is created for educational purposes, incorporating concepts from deep learning and machine learning.

Feel free to explore and modify the code for your learning and experimentation.
